## Unit 8 | Assignment - MySQL

Skills Tested:  SQL database queries, database and table creation within mySQL servers

This is a SQL script that answers a list of tasks set by the course instructor.  The tasks involve searching the query and viewing specific information relating to interconnected tables within the sakila-schema.  Searching the tables involve commands such as; Subqueries, joins, and create new tables.  The sakila database was created using two files; one is the schema file, which needed to be run first, which creates all of the tables.  To fill the tables, the second file (sakila-data), must be run second. This was my first exposure to SQL, there was quite a bit of outside research required for this homework, especially subqueries within the select statements.  Although most of the work can be completed using inner-joins, subqueries can be much more simpler to implement.
